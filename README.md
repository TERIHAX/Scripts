Also, if you're wondering where the Dex Explorer script is, it's [here](https://github.com/TERIHAX/Scripts/tree/main/Universal/Dex%20Explorers). (Sentinel Dex, Dex V1 to V4, Including Dark Dex)

And Remote Spys are [here](https://github.com/TERIHAX/Scripts/tree/main/Universal/Remote%20Spies).

SE (Script Exodus) Hub is Not Made by Me, I Just Grouped Their Scripts Into a Hub.
And If You Use SE Hub on Mad City, There is a Ban Risk, And Pet Simulator X Has Active Admins There.
